## Division Rules

### Single Division
- Sale achievement is calculated for 1 division only

### Multiple Divisions (A & B)
If one division's target accounts for **more than 20%** of total target (A + B):

**Both conditions must be satisfied:**
1. Sale Achievement of all divisions > **90%** of total target
2. Sale Achievement for each division > **70%**

| Conditions Met? | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| ✅ Yes | Sale achievement is calculated for all divisions in total |
| ❌ No | **No variable pay** received for the quarter |

### Example
```
Division A: 100
Division B: 50
Total Target: 150
Total Achievement > 90% × 150 = 135
A: > 70% × 100 = 70
B: > 70% × 50 = 35
```

---

## Sales Achievement Tiers

| Achievement Level | Payout |
|------------------|--------|
| **< 90%** | ❌ No Variable Pay |
| **90% - 105%** | Sliding curve (linear: achievement % = payout %) |
| **> 105%** | Additional Payout based on Commission Table |

### Sliding Curve (90%-105%)
- 90% achievement = 90% of variable pay
- 95% achievement = 95% of variable pay
- 100% achievement = 100% of variable pay
- 105% achievement = 105% of variable pay

### Payout Caps
- **Total Payout:** Capped at **250%** of variable pay
- **All variable bonus:** Capped at **250% of target bonus**

---

| Tier | 105% | 107% | 108% | 110% |
